# TODOs Here we go!!

* Add an options file.
	- Esp. LoC on the side...
* Lua Coc
* Nerdtree / neogit interaction
	- Would be ideal to keep neogit on it's own window
	- Map a hotkey to open
* Nerdtree
	- When we toggle focus, toggle focus in all tabs
	- This way we stay in sync
* Tabline configuration
	- What the fuck is going on here?
* Grep tool
	- This would be really nice to integrate with vim
	- Got a tool for this as well
* Better syntax highlighting / tab rules
	- Reasonable defaults for various filetypes
* neogit development?
	- Pull code from my github (super easy to set up!)


# Reflection
* At what point does this just become VSCode
	- The neogit is definitely a win
	- Good developer practice of course
	- Less memory consumption (not that we're particularly
	  memory limited, but lightweight is a good philosophy.
