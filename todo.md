# TODOs Here we go!!

* Lua Coc
* Nerdtree / neogit interaction
	- Would be ideal to keep neogit on it's own window
	- Map a hotkey to open
* Nerdtree
	- When we toggle focus, toggle focus in all tabs
	- This way we stay in sync
* Tabline configuration
	- What the fuck is going on here?
* Grep tool
	- This would be really nice to integrate with vim
	- Got a tool for this as well
* Better syntax highlighting / tab rules
