This file is an (incomplete) guide to my current system setup.

I will attempt to keep this as up-to-date as possible.

# All software installed

* Regolith
* Code (a bunch of cloned github repos)
* NPM (for JS / React Native development)


## NPM

1. Install npm...
2. Setup .npm-packages (https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/main/npm-global-without-sudo.md)
